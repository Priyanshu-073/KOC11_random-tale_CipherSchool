story= "In a small "+randomplace+" town, " +randomyears+", a small business owner owed a large sum of money to a loan-shark. The loan-shark was a "+randomfeature+" looking guy that just so happened to fancy the business owner daughter."+"He decided to offer the businessman a"+ randomdl+" that would completely wipe out the debt he owed him."+" However the catch was that we would only wipe out the debt if he could marry the businessman daughter." +"Needless to say, this proposal was met with a look of disgust."+"The loan-shark said that he would place two pebbles into a bag, one white and one black."+"The daughter would then have to reach into the bag and pick out a pebble. If it was black, the debt would be wiped, but the loan-shark would then marry her. If it was white, the debt would also be wiped, but the daughter would not have to marry the loan-shark."+"Standing on a pebble-strewn path in the businessman’s garden, the loan-shark bent over and picked up two pebbles."+"Whilst he was picking them up, the daughter noticed that he would picked up two black pebbles and placed them both into the bag."+"He then asked the daughter to reach into the bag and pick one."+"He then asked the daughter to reach into the bag and pick one."+"The clever daughter knowing drew out a pebble from the bag, and before looking at it accidentally dropped it into the midst of the other pebbles. She said to the loan-shark;"+"“Oh, how clumsy of me. Never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.”"+"The pebble left in the bag is obviously black, and seeing as the loan-shark did not want to be exposed, he had to play along as if the pebble the daughter dropped was white, and clear her father debt."
